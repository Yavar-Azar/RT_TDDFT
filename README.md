# RT_TDDFT


Here we are going to analyze data extracted from nwchem output in a **real-time tddft** tasl

If we add `print dipole ` in a rt-tddft it will print dipole vector in the given time-steps. Now, if we apply Fourier transformation over these dipole moments to find frequency-dependent linear polarizability $\alpha(\omega)$ and absorption spectra.
